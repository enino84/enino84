Welcome to my GitHub repository! Throughout my industry experience, I have had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects that highlight my skills and expertise. One significant project involved estimating prices in the freight transportation industry. I developed machine learning models using different approaches and incorporated various variables such as mode, distance, and angles. Leveraging technologies like dbt (data build tool) and Python, I implemented robust data extraction, transformation, and loading processes. I also utilized the Random Forest algorithm to ensure accurate price estimations. Additionally, I contributed to the development of a Python-based dashboard framework that streamlined the process of creating visually appealing dash applications.

This repository showcases selected projects from my industry experience, demonstrating my proficiency in data science and software development. One noteworthy project focused on developing a data engineering solution using Microsoft Azure services. The solution involved data ingestion and exchange with GraphQL, efficient data management using Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Factory, and the implementation of an Azure Function for data formatting. Another project centered around developing Python applications for payroll departments, utilizing Microsoft Azure Functions and SQL Server for customized report generation. I also gained experience in project management using Azure DevOps. These projects highlight my expertise in Python development, data engineering, and the utilization of cloud technologies. Feel free to explore the code and projects, and I welcome any collaborations or feedback.
